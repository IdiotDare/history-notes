this is my fucking history notes also theyre my notes, not my words. Paraphrased/copied, alright? No guarantee on accuracy
For now, it's just Chinese dynasties.

<h2>First up, Shang.</h2>

They extended the kingdom to the Xia Kingdom in the north, and south of the Yellow river.

They created:
  1. The Chinese writing system
    -over 10,000 characters
    -7 main dialect groups, but hundreds of sub-dialects(because of all the ethnic groups)
    -a common writing system was necessary for unity
  2. The notion of filiat piety
    -respected for parents and the ancestors of the father
    -generations lived together, the eldest male controlled everything(money,important decisions)

Girls/women were treated as inferior, raised to obey the males in the family. They were married off between the ages of 13-16, becoming part of their husbands' families.

The Shang dynasty was polytheistic with a supreme God, and many less Gods.

The Dynastic Cycle, can be considered the life cycle of a dynasty.
  1. Strong dynasty establishes peace and prosperity; considered to have Mandate of Heaven.
  2. Over time, the dynasty becomes corrupt; taxes get raised; power grows weaker.
  3. Disasters(diseases, famine, floods, revolts) happen.
  4. Because said dynasty is seen as having lost the Mandate of Heaven(God's approval), it justifies rebellions.
  5. Dynasty gets overthrown through revolts and bloodshed, and a new dynasty emerges.
  6. The new dynasty gains power; restores peace and order, claims to have Mandate of Heaven.
  7. Start back at 1.
This concept was created by the Zhou dynasty.

<h2>Zhou dynasty</h2>
The Zhou dynasty started the concept of the Dynastic Cycle and the Mandate of Heaven as an excuse to overthrow the Shang.
